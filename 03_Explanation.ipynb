    "- I have down-sampled the data set to daily frequency, as some cryptos are not that active at a minute level\n",
    "- I have also filtered out cryptos listed after 2018, to make sure there are enough data points to produce statistically signifcant result\n",
    "- After the two transformations above, we have a clean data set with 4 years of data (1461 observations) and 49 symbols\n",
    "- The first half would be used as training data and the second half would be used as testing data\n",
    "- Daily returns are calculated and correlations are then computed to find highly correlated pairs (visualized by the clustermap)\n",
    "- This gives us a cluster of 17 symbols\n",
    "- We then perform cointegration test to find the pairs that are truly cointegrating, which gives us 57 pairs in the end"

    "- For each of the pair, we would first use Johansen test to determine the optimal hedge ratio\n",
    "- With the hedge ratio, we could then proceed to produce a univeriate spread time series\n",
    "- Next, we would calculate the 30-day rolling mean and standard deviation\n",
    "- Finally, we could produce a tradable signal, z-score, with the spread standardized by the rolling mean and standard deviation\n",
    "- In my backtesting, my entry signal would be triggered whenever the absolute value of z-score exceeds 2 and I would close the position when the z-score hits zero.\n",
    "- We repeat the above procedures for all the pairs and calculate the cumulative returns over the testing period of 2 years\n",
    "- A quick look at the distribution of terminal wealth shows us the returns are negatively skewed with a positive mean of 1.3 (i.e. our wealth would be more than doubled in just 2 years, which is not that surprising given the volatility of cryptos)"

    "- Financial returns usually exhibit positive serial correlation, which is an important criteria for momentum strategies\n",

    "- There are a few exceptions (avtusd, rrtusd, sanbtc, saneth) that show a very slight negative correlation at the first lag, which coincides with the well-known one-day reversal pattern\n",
    "- However, after binning the factor (previous day return) into 5 buckets and looking at the distribution of next day return, we could see that the edge is too small for a profitable strategy (especially after accounting for transaction cost)\n",
    "- I have repeated the above analysis for weekly returns as well and it yields similar result (i.e. there is no correlation between previous week return and this week return)"
